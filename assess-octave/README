Programs for leave-one-out calculations on enrichment scores to create test and train sets for classification.

Use either formatForOctave.pl or formatForOctave.m to format expression gct file, phenotype cls file, and geneset gmt file to be used in octave.
	Inputs: expression gct file, phenotype label cls file, geneset gmt file
	Output: expression.txt, labels.txt, listind.txt

octaveEnrich.m, enrich.m, npcorrelations.m, cell2mat.m: octave-2.1.72 programs for calculating enrichment of test and train samples.
	Inputs: expression.txt, labels.txt, listind.txt (from formatForOctave.m			or formatForOctave.pl)
	Outputs: train#.txt, test#.txt (where #= test sample's index in expressi		on data set)
This is to be run from the command line by octave-2.1.72 octaveEnrich.m # or run on cluster using .q file (for an example, see enrich.q)
